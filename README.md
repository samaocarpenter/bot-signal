# bot-signal

**Bot detection for JavaScript and Node.js — detect headless Chrome, Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium and scripted input.**

`bot-signal` is an open-source, TypeScript-first bot detection library that scores three
independent layers: **instant** browser checks (automation artifacts, native tampering,
cross-realm and GPU contradictions, CDP), **behavioral** analysis of mouse, touch, scroll and
typing, and **server-side** IP reputation, TLS/JA3 fingerprint and timezone validation. Start
with one `isHuman()` call, or read every weighted signal yourself. No API keys, no external
service, no data leaves your infrastructure.

## Why bot-signal?

Most bot-detection snippets are copy-pasted checks that rot quickly. The `bot-signal` package gives you a maintained, typed, testable toolkit that covers the full stack:

**[Live demo](https://okasi.github.io/bot-signal/)** — run instant and behavioral checks in your browser.

| Layer | Runs where | Catches |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Instant** | Browser (sync/async) | Automation artifacts, native tampering, realm/UA/GPU inconsistencies, CDP |
| **Behavioral** | Browser (over time) | Robotic mouse/scroll/typing, synthetic events |
| **Server** | Node >= 22 | Datacenter IPs, AbuseIPDB, TLS fingerprint mismatch, timezone spoofing |

- **No API keys** — GeoIP and IP blocklists are bundled and updated weekly (note: the full package is ~1.8 MB tarball / ~16 MB unpacked primarily due to the blocklist data)
- **TypeScript-first** — full types, ESM + CJS, `sideEffects: false`
- **Bundler-safe** — the root import resolves to a browser-only build in browser bundlers; explicit `/browser` and `/server` subpaths when you want to be precise
- **IPv4 + IPv6** — blocklist matching handles IPv6 ranges and IPv4-mapped addresses, all via binary search (~1µs per lookup)
- **Composable** — use one layer or combine all three
- **Explainable** — every flag has a name, weight, and confidence level
- **One dependency** — just the offline GeoIP database

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm install bot-signal
```

### Browser — block automation on page load

```ts
import { isHuman } from "bot-signal";

if (!isHuman(window)) {
  window.location.href = "/blocked";
}
```

### Server — score a request in one call

```ts
import { detectServerClientAsync } from "bot-signal";

const result = await detectServerClientAsync({
  clientIp: req.ip,
  clientTimezone: req.headers["x-timezone"],
  userAgent: req.headers["user-agent"],
  tlsFingerprint: req.headers["x-ja3-hash"],
});

if (!result.isLegitClient) {
  return res.status(403).json({ signals: result.signals });
}
```

### Behavioral — catch scripted interaction

```ts
import { createBehavioralClientDetector } from "bot-signal";

const result = await createBehavioralClientDetector({ context: window }).observe(10_000);

if (!result.isLegitClient) {
  console.warn("Robotic behavior", result.suspicionScore);
}
```

### Entry points

| Import | Contents | Runs in |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `bot-signal` | Everything (browser build in browser bundlers) + `isHuman()` | Browser + Node |
| `bot-signal/browser` | Instant + behavioral only | Browser |
| `bot-signal/server` | Server detection only | Node ≥ 22 |

No bundler? Load the global build from a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/bot-signal"></script>
<script>
  // The global is `BotSignal` (the package name is `bot-signal`)
  if (!BotSignal.isHuman(window)) {
    location.href = "/blocked";
  }
</script>
```

| Mode | API | Speed | Environment |
|------|-----|-------|-------------|
| **Instant** | `isHuman` (or `detectInstantClient`) | Immediate | Browser |
| **Instant+** | `isHumanAsync` (or `detectInstantClientAsync`) | Usually <500ms | Browser (adds WebGPU, CDP, permissions, high-entropy UA-CH, worker checks) |
| **Behavioral** | `createBehavioralClientDetector` | 5–30s | Browser |
| **Server** | `detectServerClientAsync` | ~1–5ms per IP | Node >= 22 |

### Instant

`bot-signal`'s instant mode runs synchronously against `window` and returns a weighted `suspicionScore`
(`1 - Π(1 - weight)` over triggered signals). Definitive automation markers
weigh 1.0 and block on their own; ambiguous checks that also fire on real
clients (in-app browsers, F11 fullscreen, GPU-less VMs) weigh 0.25–0.45 so they
only block in combination. `isLegitClient` is `suspicionScore < scoreThreshold`
(default 0.5) — tune it to taste. The async variant adds WebGPU `shader-f16`,
CDP serialization, Notification/Permissions consistency, high-entropy Client
Hints, and worker-realm validation.

```ts
if (!isHuman(window)) {
  // block
}

// full result if you need details
const result = detectInstantClient(window);
// result.suspicionScore, result.confidence, result.signals[], result.isLegitClient
// result.automation.kind, .confidence, .evidence, .alternatives

// stricter: block on any single soft signal
const strict = detectInstantClient(window, { scoreThreshold: 0.3 });

const withWebGpu = await isHumanAsync(window); // or detectInstantClientAsync
```

### Behavioral

`bot-signal`'s behavioral mode observes mouse movement, clicks, touch gestures,
scrolling, and keyboard events. Score: `1 - Π(1 - weight)` across triggered signals.

```ts
const detector = createBehavioralClientDetector({
  context: window,
  scoreThreshold: 0.55,
  onUpdate: (r) => console.log(r.suspicionScore),
});
await detector.observe(8_000);
```

### Server

`bot-signal`'s server mode passes `clientIp` to auto-run GeoIP lookup, datacenter range check, AbuseIPDB blocklist, iCloud Private Relay check, TLS validation, and timezone comparison.

```ts
const result = await detectServerClientAsync({
  clientIp: req.ip,
  clientTimezone: req.headers["x-timezone"],
  tlsFingerprint: req.headers["x-ja3-hash"],
  userAgent: req.headers["user-agent"],
  clientUserAgent: req.body.browser?.userAgent,
  clientLanguage: req.body.browser?.language,
  clientLanguages: req.body.browser?.languages,
  clientPlatform: req.body.browser?.platform,
  secChUa: req.headers["sec-ch-ua"],
  secChUaPlatform: req.headers["sec-ch-ua-platform"],
  secChUaMobile: req.headers["sec-ch-ua-mobile"],
  secFetchSite: req.headers["sec-fetch-site"],
  secFetchMode: req.headers["sec-fetch-mode"],
  secFetchDest: req.headers["sec-fetch-dest"],
  // Set only from trusted edge verification, never a client header:
  crawlerVerificationStatus: req.botIdentity?.status,
});
```

`tlsFingerprint` must come from infrastructure that actually terminated the
TLS connection (for example, trusted reverse-proxy metadata). Strip any
client-supplied fingerprint header at the edge before adding the trusted value;
an arbitrary request header is attacker-controlled and is not JA3/JA4 evidence.
No client-family TLS hashes are bundled because fingerprints vary by TLS stack
and version and do not prove the calling library. Use
`suspiciousTlsFingerprints` for reputation-only JA3/JA4 values, or
`suspiciousTlsFingerprintEntries` with a trusted `families` label when you also
want TLS/User-Agent consistency and attribution corroboration.

Both instant and server results include an `automation` assessment. When
page-realm artifacts are exposed they can identify `playwright`, `puppeteer`,
`selenium`, `phantomjs`, or `nightmare`. A scripting-client User-Agent can
suggest `curl`, `python`, `go`, or `java`; explicit UA products can identify a
`browser-automation`, `playwright`, `puppeteer`, `selenium`, or `phantomjs`
family. Crawler and generic HTTP-client UAs use `kind: "unknown"` with explicit
evidence to preserve the package's closed attribution union. TLS fingerprints only add risk or
corroborating evidence and never identify a family alone. When fingerprints
overlap, the result uses `browser-automation` plus `alternatives`. Patchright
can appear as an
alternative when a Chromium automation pattern is present, but generic
environment anomalies never identify Patchright on their own.
`automation.isAutomated` records evidence independently of the
configured enforcement threshold; `isLegitClient` remains the policy verdict.
An automation `kind` of `unknown` means no supported client-family kind was
selected, not that the request was proven human; inspect `evidence` and
`signals` for crawler, HTTP-client, or generic bot attribution.
This is intentionally probabilistic: a page cannot prove which Node/Python
package controls a browser after all brand-specific artifacts are removed.
Server reputation/geo signals can make `isLegitClient` false without setting
`automation.isAutomated`; a risky IP is not automatically a browser bot.

Bundled IP data is refreshed weekly. Run locally: `npm run update:ip-data`.

## Signals

### Instant (weighted)

Each check contributes its weight to `suspicionScore`; `isLegitClient` is
`suspicionScore < scoreThreshold` (default 0.5). Every boolean flag is still on
the result for inspection, alongside `signals[]` with per-check weights.
Distinctive Playwright, Puppeteer, and ChromeDriver artifacts block on their
own. Generic legacy or embedded-runtime markers stay soft because ordinary
applications can reuse those global names.

**Browser fingerprint protection is not automation.** Protection rewrites
Navigator values per realm by design — Opera 133 reports 2 cores and a
normalised locale to the page while its workers report the machine's real 10 —
so the cross-realm checks are deliberately split by how reachable each realm
is:

- `isWorkerInconsistent` compares one thing: whether the two realms name a
  different **operating system**. Everything softer turned out to be something
  a stock browser does — protection normalises the locale in the document but
  not in a worker, and User-Agent reduction and per-site compatibility
  overrides change the browser version in the document only. Locale, raw
  strings, browser version, and `hardwareConcurrency` are all left out.
- `isWebDriverInWorker` is FPScanner-inspired and fires only if a non-standard
  worker property exposes the definitive boolean value `true`; WebDriver does
  not normally define this property on `WorkerNavigator`. Missing worker
  support or an absent worker property returns `null`.
- `isWorkerWebGLInconsistent` compares the unmasked vendor and renderer only
  when both realms expose complete values. Missing OffscreenCanvas, WebGL, or
  debug-renderer data returns `null` and contributes no suspicion. It remains
  a soft corroborating signal because privacy tooling can rewrite only the page.
- `isIframeInconsistent` compares no Navigator values, because an
  `about:blank` frame is the realm every content script reaches — ad blockers,
  privacy tools, and the extensions Chromium forks ship built in all inject
  there. It fires only when the frame hands back the page's own `window` or
  `navigator`, or when the realms disagree about `navigator.webdriver`. Neither
  is reachable by injected code. A missing `window.chrome` inside a fresh frame
  is ignored entirely, since Chromium forks and Electron do that legitimately.

For the same reason `isMediaQueryInconsistent` compares only `resolution`
against `devicePixelRatio` — Opera reports `screen.colorDepth` 24 on a 10-bit
display, so no mapping onto the CSS `color` query survives contact with a stock
browser — and `isCanvasTampered` allows ±8 per channel, clearing both
colour-managed readback and injected per-origin noise.

`isCanvasNoiseInjected` is the complement to that tolerance: instead of asking
what a pixel is, it asks whether the same render answers twice the same way.
Fingerprint protection that ships in a browser seeds its noise per session and
per origin, so it stays self-consistent; only a spoofer that re-randomises on
every call disagrees with itself. It compares **pixels**, never `toDataURL()`:
PNG encoding is not byte-stable, and identical pixels were measured producing
different encodings on the same Chromium build depending on the page's origin.

Signals weighted below the 0.5 threshold are soft: individually they flag but
don't block, so common false-positive cases (in-app browsers, kiosk fullscreen,
VMs) pass unless they stack. `isEmptyPlugins` is skipped entirely on mobile
Chrome, which legitimately reports no plugins. The Chromium-only CDP probes
use medium confidence and contribute at most one 0.25 signal when either or
both trigger, because an open DevTools session can also serialize the
diagnostic objects.

### Behavioral (weighted)

| ID | Weight | Confidence | Description |
|----|--------|------------|-------------|
| `no-mouse-activity` | 0.20 | low | Pointer clicks with zero mouse/touch events |
| `click-without-mouse-movement` | 0.35 | high | Click with no mouse or touch activity in the prior 2s |
| `linear-mouse-movement` | 0.25 | medium | Straight path cut into equal steps or covered at uniform speed |
| `interpolated-mouse-path` | 0.40 | high | Six or more mouse moves repeat an identical step vector (compared on the fractional `pointermove` position), as `mouse.move(x, y, { steps })` produces |
| `instant-click-press` | 0.30 | medium | A mouse button released under 5 ms after being pressed; tap-driven clicks are exempt |
| `centered-clicks` | 0.35 | medium | Two or more clicks land within 1 px of the centre of their target, or one of its three nearest ancestors (targets at least 16 px square) |
| `zero-mouse-movement-deltas` | 0.30 | medium | More than 50 mouse events all report zero `movementX`/`movementY` |
| `cdp-input-coordinate-leak` | 0.20 | low | Two distinct trusted pointer positions have identical page/screen coordinates; a soft CDP hint because ordinary window/scroll geometry can collide |
| `teleport-mouse` | 0.40 | high | Implausible cursor jumps between closely-spaced events |
| `linear-touch-movement` | 0.25 | medium | Swipe path is straight, cut into equal steps or at uniform speed |
| `teleport-touch` | 0.40 | high | Contact point jumps implausibly mid-gesture |
| `linear-tap-rhythm` | 0.30 | medium | Robotic or superhuman tap intervals |
| `linear-scroll` | 0.30 | medium | Uniform scroll deltas/timing |
| `linear-typing` | 0.35 | high | Robotic or superhuman intervals (key auto-repeat excluded) |
| `synthetic-events` | 0.50 | high | `isTrusted === false` |

Touch devices are scored, not just tolerated: swipe paths and tap rhythm go
through the same linearity and teleport heuristics as mouse movement, so a
phone or tablet is analysed rather than waved through. Each new contact starts
a fresh gesture, so lifting a finger and landing elsewhere never reads as a
jump, and multi-finger activity (pinch, rotate) is recorded but excluded from
gesture analysis, since interleaved contacts would look like one point
teleporting between fingers.

Touch taps, keyboard-activated clicks (`detail === 0`), and cursor re-entry
after leaving the window are recognized and never counted against the user.

The exact numeric thresholds inside the heuristics (linearity CV cutoffs,
distance/time teleport rules, etc.) are tuned constants. They are not
currently exposed as options in order to keep the public API small and
predictable. See source for the documented constants if you need to fork
the logic.

### Server (weighted)

| ID | Weight | Confidence | Description |
|----|--------|------------|-------------|
| `scripting-user-agent` | 0.75 | medium | UA claims curl/Python/Go/Java |
| `bot-user-agent` | 0.90 | high | UA claims a conservative known bot, HTTP-client, or automation product token |
| `crawler-identity-spoofed` | 0.95 | high | Trusted Web Bot Auth, FCrDNS/CIDR, or equivalent verification rejected a crawler claim |
| `client-hints-mismatch` | 0.65 | high | Chromium UA version conflicts with `sec-ch-ua` |
| `client-user-agent-mismatch` | 0.80 | high | HTTP UA conflicts with `navigator.userAgent` from a client beacon |
| `client-language-mismatch` | 0.45 | medium | Accept-Language conflicts with Navigator languages |
| `client-platform-mismatch` | 0.55 | high | UA OS conflicts with Navigator or UA-CH platform |
| `client-hints-mobile-mismatch` | 0.55 | high | `sec-ch-ua-mobile` conflicts with the UA |
| `missing-browser-headers` | 0.35 | medium | Browser UA lacks Fetch Metadata headers (opt-in) |
| `timezone-mismatch` | 0.45 | high | Client TZ ≠ GeoIP TZ (sub-threshold: VPNs/travelers don't block alone) |
| `known-suspicious-tls` | 0.55 | high / entry confidence | JA3/JA4 matches a caller-supplied suspicious value |
| `tls-user-agent-mismatch` | 0.50 | entry confidence | JA3/JA4 family conflicts with User-Agent |
| `missing-tls-fingerprint` | 0.25 | medium | Browser UA without a TLS fingerprint |
| `accept-language-geo-mismatch` | 0.20 | low | No acceptable Accept-Language country matches GeoIP (region-less, numeric-region, and q=0-only headers pass) |
| `datacenter-browser-mismatch` | 0.35 | medium | Datacenter IP + browser UA |
| `abuse-listed-ip` | 0.60 | high | AbuseIPDB 30-day blocklist |
| `icloud-private-relay` | 0.15 | low | iCloud Private Relay egress |

`crawlerVerificationStatus` must come from infrastructure you trust, just like
`tlsFingerprint`; never copy it from a client-supplied header. Only `spoofed`
triggers `crawler-identity-spoofed`. `verified` does not whitelist a crawler—the
separate `bot-user-agent` signal still reports that the client is a bot so the
host application can apply its own verified-bot policy. Even without a
recognized UA, `verified` sets `automation.isAutomated` while remaining
score-neutral. Use `spoofed` only for a conclusive known-identity mismatch;
ambiguous authentication errors must be `unverified`.

**Bundled IP data:** `data/datacenter_ip_ranges.csv` (ipcat), `data/abuse_ip_db_30d_ips.csv` (AbuseIPDB), `data/icloud_private_relay_ip_ranges.csv` (Apple, IPv4 + IPv6).

Lists are parsed once into sorted intervals (~0.5s, lazily on first `clientIp`
check); each lookup is then a binary search (~1µs). IPv4-mapped IPv6 input
(`::ffff:1.2.3.4`) normalizes to IPv4 before matching. Call `preloadIpLists()`
once at boot to move that one-off parse cost out of the first request.

> **Note on caching:** `getIpListChecker` uses a module-level cache. In
> environments that load both ESM and CJS versions of the package you may
> observe separate caches. This is harmless for the vast majority of use cases.

> **IPv6 note:** the abuse and iCloud Relay lists cover IPv6, but the bundled
> GeoIP database and the ipcat datacenter list are IPv4-only — so
> `timezone-mismatch`, `accept-language-geo-mismatch`, and
> `datacenter-browser-mismatch` don't yet apply to IPv6 clients. Pass
> `ipTimezone`/`ipCountry`/`isDatacenterIp` yourself if you have an IPv6-capable
> source.

### Reference checker coverage

The referenced public checker pages and open-source detectors/tools were
audited against the library. `bot-signal` implements reusable passive signals and cross-layer
contradictions; it deliberately does not turn every fingerprint value or
browser feature absence into bot evidence.

| Checker | Coverage in `bot-signal` | Boundary |
|---------|--------------------------|----------|
| [Sannysoft Antibot](https://bot.sannysoft.com/) | UA/WebDriver/getter, Chrome object, permissions, plugins/MIME/languages, iframe realm/WebDriver consistency, Selenium/PhantomJS/Sequentum globals and document attributes | Generic `window.phantom` is omitted because the Phantom wallet uses it; alert timing, broken-image pixels, battery, codecs, iframe Chrome state, and detailed WebGL expectations are intrusive or high-noise |
| [Incolumitas Bot Detection](https://bot.incolumitas.com/) | Header-vs-JS UA/language, native getter and plugin integrity, worker consistency, RTT, behavior, IP/TLS/timezone/datacenter signals | Its server challenge classifiers and network latency/open-port tests require site-owned infrastructure |
| [Rebrowser Bot Detector](https://bot-detector.rebrowser.net/) | CDP serialization, Playwright/Puppeteer globals, exposed bindings and init scripts, WebDriver getter, default viewport, automation-specific stack URLs | Treating any own Navigator property as automation, CSP bypass, main-world hooks, honeypot access, live stable-version comparison, and requiring Google Chrome branding/high-entropy data (which rejects legitimate unbranded Chromium) are intentionally omitted |
| [Pixelscan Bot Check](https://pixelscan.net/bot-check) | WebDriver/CDP, Selenium/ChromeDriver, Electron/Phantom/Awesomium/CEF/FMiner/Geb/Phantomas-style artifacts, headless UA, native tampering, unusual environment combinations | Pixelscan's private “advanced” model is not published |
| [Scrapfly Automation Detector](https://scrapfly.io/web-scraping-tools/automation-detector) | All stable passive categories: WebDriver, UA, plugins/MIME/languages, native functions/descriptors, Selenium/ChromeDriver/Phantom artifacts, permissions | `chrome.runtime` is intentionally not required: it is an extension API and is absent on ordinary pages |
| [DeviceAndBrowserInfo](https://deviceandbrowserinfo.com/are_you_a_bot) | Main/iframe WebDriver consistency, worker WebDriver/OS/WebGL consistency, automation globals, bot UA, WebGL availability/software GPU, WebGPU feature, hardware/default-screen, CDP, high-entropy UA-CH, canvas and behavior | The iframe `self.get` hook is omitted because extensions can define it; population-based GPU, timing, and shader-backend expectations remain version-dependent; distinctive globals are checked once rather than re-polled every ~200ms |
| [APIVoid Bot Detection](https://www.apivoid.com/tools/bot-detection-test/) | Screen/zero-window, scripting/headless/bot UA, Navigator identity/platform/touch consistency, WebDriver, hardware, plugins, permissions, WebGL availability/software GPU, canvas, automation properties | Cookie availability, WebRTC-vs-public-IP comparison, Web Audio, SpeechSynthesis, Bluetooth, font/media capabilities, and engine/version baselines are not scored as standalone bot signals |
| [Fingerprint Web Scraping Prevention](https://demo.fingerprint.com/web-scraping) | Public BotD-style UA, runtime, document, plugin, permission, WebGL, window, and distinctive-property categories | The commercial Web Scraping Smart Signal is a proprietary server model and cannot be reproduced locally |
| [FingerprintJS BotD](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/BotD) | Its open-source UA, engine, runtime, document, permission, plugin, WebGL, and window detectors map to instant signals | Generic Node-style `emit`/`spawn` globals are omitted because ordinary applications can expose them |
| [FPScanner](https://fpscanner.com/) | WebDriver/descriptors, Selenium/Playwright/CDP, screen/hardware, engine/platform/GPU contradictions, iframe WebDriver, worker WebDriver/OS, and the soft worker/page WebGL comparison | UTC timezone, high core counts, iframe platform strings, and other raw cross-realm differences are too common on legitimate privacy-protected or virtualized browsers |
| [Brotector](https://ttlns.github.io/brotector/) | Playwright/ChromeDriver globals, CDP serialization, untrusted input, and a low-weight trusted CDP Input page/screen-coordinate hint | Empty high-entropy UA-CH can be caused by policy/privacy withholding; mobile touch-coordinate equality is noisy, while debugger stalls, popup crashes, PDF styling, and function hooks are intrusive |
| [HMaker Selenium Detector](https://hmaker.github.io/selenium-detector/) | Named Selenium/ChromeDriver artifacts plus descriptor-only detection of renamed Array/Promise/Symbol aliases and the exact element-cache prototype | Renamed aliases are checked in the main realm only; active query-selector call-stack hooks and execute/async token challenges are not installed into application code |
| [FCaptcha](https://webdecoy.com/product/fcaptcha-demo/) | Existing synthetic-event, movement-delta, teleport, scroll, typing, tap, and touch-gesture signals overlap with its passive behavior model | Key dwell/rollover, coalesced-pointer and delta coherence, micro-motion, touch force/radius, sensor entropy, paste/fill, form cadence, and proof-of-work need broader form-specific collection or challenge infrastructure |
| [InfoSimples Detect Headless](https://infosimples.github.io/detect-headless/) | UA/appVersion, WebDriver, Chrome object, permissions, plugin/MIME prototypes, languages, window size, RTT, CDP, and zero mouse movement deltas | Blocking `alert()` timing and broken-image probes are intrusive/obsolete and are not run |
| [Intoli Headless Chrome Test](https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/chrome-headless-test.html) | UA, WebDriver, Chrome object, permissions, plugins, languages | Covered by the instant and async result fields above |
| [CreepJS Fingerprint Checker](https://creepjs.org/checker) | Relevant lie/tamper and cross-realm consistency categories map to native, canvas, UA/platform, WebGL/WebGPU, timezone, language, and worker signals | Its raw rendering/device/media/font values are fingerprint inputs, not bot detections |
| [BrowserLeaks JavaScript](https://browserleaks.com/javascript) | Relevant Navigator/screen/language/timezone/CPU/plugin contradictions are covered | The page is a JavaScript capability/fingerprint viewer and does not publish a bot verdict |
| [BrowserScan](https://www.browserscan.net/) | UA/OS/client-hint, webdriver, screen/touch/memory, canvas, WebGL availability/software GPU, WebGPU feature, timezone/language, IP/blocklist/TLS/JA3/JA4 categories | Detailed GPU “correctness” needs BrowserScan's private population and browser-version baselines |
| [Scrapfly Browser Fingerprint](https://scrapfly.io/web-scraping-tools/browser-fingerprint) | Consistency signals cover screen, canvas, GPU availability, Navigator, UA-CH, MIME, permissions, timezone, and language | Server-profile population matching plus audio/fonts/codecs/DRM/voices are fingerprint inputs, not direct local automation evidence |
| [BrowserAudit](https://browseraudit.com/) | No BrowserAudit security-conformance assertions are executed | BrowserAudit is a standards/security suite, not a bot detector; its 400+ assertions are out of scope for bot scoring |
| [tls.peet.ws](https://tls.peet.ws/) / [fpcheck](https://github.com/North-web-dev/fpcheck) | Their JA3/JA4 portions map to caller-supplied fingerprints, family-labelled profiles, and UA-family mismatch | JA4H, Akamai HTTP/2 settings/order, and raw header-order profiles are not accepted or hardcoded because browser versions and intermediaries change them; callers can enforce trusted edge profiles separately |
| [CrawlerDetect](https://crawlerdetect.io/) | Conservative bot/crawler UA tokens are detected in both browser and server layers | A broad self-declared-UA corpus is neither proof of automation nor verified crawler identity, so it is not imported wholesale |
| [Cloudflare Web Bot Auth test](https://crawltest.com/cdn-cgi/web-bot-auth) | Cryptographic verification is performed at the edge; a successful trusted verdict can feed `crawlerVerificationStatus: "verified"` | This package does not verify HTTP Message Signatures locally; Cloudflare 401 conflates unknown keys with signature failure, so 400/401/non-200 responses must remain `unverified`, not `spoofed` |
| [Google crawler verification](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/crawlers-fetchers/verify-google-requests) / [Bingbot verification](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/how-to-verify-bingbot-3905dc26) | A trusted Google/Bing FCrDNS result, or a Google published-IP-range result, can feed `crawlerVerificationStatus`; conclusive spoofing adds a high-confidence signal | DNS verification and Google range refresh belong in infrastructure with caching; lookup failures must remain `unverified`, and Bing ranges must not be hardcoded |
| [VexTrio Fingerprint Analyzer](https://github.com/HackingLZ/fingerprint_js) — the [threat actor's own script](https://gi7w0rm.medium.com/vextrios-browser-fingerprinting-aeb721be6e30), plus 2022–2025 extensions | Language/screen/platform/`oscpu`/`productSub`/ETSL/WebGL-vendor contradictions, automation globals, permission anomalies, GREASE brands, Intl-vs-`Date` timezone, deviceMemory grid, Apple/Google speech voices | `AudioContext.sampleRate`, `pdfViewerEnabled`, `document.hasFocus()`, and macOS `screen.availTop` are rejected: Bluetooth audio, a user setting, a background tab, and a secondary display each move them on real hardware |
| [rebrowser-patches](https://github.com/rebrowser/rebrowser-patches) | Each leak it patches is a detection vector — `Runtime.Enable` CDP serialization, `pptr:` source URLs, utility-world names, exposed bindings — and all are already scored | The patches themselves are evasion tooling; the value here is the enumeration of what leaks, not the fixes |
| [CloakBrowser](https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser) | Its 71 source-level spoofing patches read backwards as a detection map: canvas/audio/WebGL noise seeds, screen and hardware overrides, timezone/locale, and the dedicated Windows speech-voice tables that motivated `isVoiceListInconsistent` | Font metrics, storage quota, and WebRTC ICE candidates are fingerprint inputs or need infrastructure, and are not scored locally |
| [niespodd/browser-fingerprinting](https://github.com/niespodd/browser-fingerprinting) | Survey of anti-bot vendors and stealth tooling; confirms canvas/audio override detection and cross-realm inconsistency as the durable signal classes | p0f TCP-stack OS matching and font-rendering-backend leaks are edge/infrastructure concerns, not browser-side checks |
| [azerpas/detect-headless](https://github.com/azerpas/detect-headless) | Compiles the Akamai/DataDome property probes — automation globals, `window.chrome`, WebRTC presence, screen/window geometry, ChromeDriver `cdc_` keys | Bare capability presence (`XDomainRequest`, `DeviceMotionEvent`, `emit`, `spawn`) is not bot evidence on its own |
| [paulirish/headless-cat-n-mouse](https://github.com/paulirish/headless-cat-n-mouse) / [infosimples/detect-headless](https://github.com/infosimples/detect-headless) | The detection-vs-evasion pairs it tracks are covered by the headless UA, `window.chrome`, permission, plugin, and RTT signals | Already reflected in the InfoSimples row above |

Challenge-only tests belong in the host application because they require a
nonce, CSP policy, instrumented main world, network endpoint, or historical
population baseline. Optional capability absence is omitted or kept soft to
avoid blocking privacy-hardened browsers, assistive environments, VMs, and
legitimate embedded browsers.

## API

All APIs are exported from the `bot-signal` package:

```ts
// Browser (also available from the root import)
import {
  isHuman,
  isHumanAsync,
  detectInstantClient,
  detectInstantClientAsync,
  buildInstantSignals,
  createBehavioralClientDetector,
  analyzeBehavioralSamples,
  isAutomationArtifacts,
  isSoftwareRenderer,
  VERSION,
} from "bot-signal/browser";

// Server (also available from the root import in Node)
import {
  detectServerClient,
  detectServerClientAsync,
  enrichServerContext,
  lookupClientIpGeo,
  createIpListChecker,
  preloadIpLists,
  parseIp,
  isTimezoneMismatch,
  isTlsUserAgentMismatch,
  isValidJa3Hash,
  KNOWN_SUSPICIOUS_TLS_FINGERPRINTS,
  VERSION,
} from "bot-signal/server";
```

### Server options

```ts
detectServerClientAsync(context, {
  dataDir: "./custom-data",
  lookupGeo: true,
  checkIpLists: true,
  timezoneToleranceMinutes: 60,
  scoreThreshold: 0.5,
  requireTlsFingerprint: false,
  requireBrowserHeaders: false,
  suspiciousTlsFingerprints: [],
  suspiciousTlsFingerprintEntries: [
    {
      id: "trusted-curl-ja3",
      label: "Trusted curl JA3",
      fingerprintType: "ja3", // optional; defaults to ja3
      hash: "e7d705a3286e19ea42f587b344ee6865",
      families: ["curl"],
      confidence: "high",
    },
  ],
});
```

For JA4, set `tlsFingerprintType: "ja4"` on the request context as well as
`fingerprintType: "ja4"` on the structured entry; the context defaults to JA3.

### Behavioral options

```ts
createBehavioralClientDetector({
  context: window,
  minObservationMs: 3_000,
  scoreThreshold: 0.55,
  pollIntervalMs: 1_000,
  sampleWindowMs: 60_000, // retain only recent samples (Infinity = keep all)
  onUpdate: (result) => {},
});
```

A long-lived detector (`start()` without `stop()`) keeps only the last
`sampleWindowMs` of events, so memory stays bounded. `observe()` rejects if an
observation is already in progress.

## Examples

### Defense in depth

```ts
if (!isHuman(window)) block();

fetch("/api/beacon", {
  headers: { "X-Timezone": Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone },
});

const behavioral = await createBehavioralClientDetector({ context: window }).observe(10_000);
if (!behavioral.isLegitClient) challenge();

const server = await detectServerClientAsync({ clientIp: req.ip /* ... */ });
if (!server.isLegitClient) return res.status(403).end();
```

### Express middleware

```ts
import { detectServerClientAsync } from "bot-signal";

app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
  const result = await detectServerClientAsync({
    clientIp: req.ip,
    clientTimezone: req.headers["x-timezone"],
    userAgent: req.headers["user-agent"],
    tlsFingerprint: req.headers["x-ja3-hash"],
  });

  if (!result.isLegitClient) {
    return res.status(403).json({ signals: result.signals });
  }
  next();
});
```

### Next.js client guard

```tsx
"use client";
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { isHuman } from "bot-signal";

export function BotGuard({ children }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isHuman(window)) {
      window.location.href = "/blocked";
    }
  }, []);
  return children;
}
```

## FAQ

**Can client-side checks be bypassed?**  
Yes. Use instant + behavioral for friction; server detection for authoritative decisions.

**False positives?**  
Every layer is weighted, so ambiguous single signals (in-app browsers, F11
fullscreen, GPU-less VMs, VPN timezone mismatches) flag but don't block on their
own — they only cross the threshold in combination. Tune `scoreThreshold` per
layer to trade friction for coverage.

**How often is IP data updated?**
Weekly (Mondays 04:00 UTC). Run `npm run update:ip-data` locally anytime.

**Works without bundlers?**
Yes — ESM + CJS + types, plus a global IIFE build on unpkg/jsdelivr (`DetectBotClient.*`).

**Why does headless Chrome fail the WebGL check?**
Chromium 139+ removed the software WebGL fallback, so GPU-less headless
sessions expose no WebGL at all — which is exactly what `isWebGLSupported`
flags. Real desktop browsers with working GPUs pass.

**Can you identify Patchright with certainty?**
No client-side library can reliably prove the controller package after a
stealth driver removes its unique leaks. The test suite verifies that
page-owned JavaScript classifies the default headless Chromium launched by
Patchright as generic `browser-automation`; the triggering `HeadlessChrome`
marker is not Patchright-specific. Combine instant, behavioral, TLS/header,
IP, and rate-limit signals for enforcement instead of blocking on a framework
label alone.

```

Live demo: https://okasi.github.io/bot-signal/ (deployed from `.pages/` on push to `main`).

**GitHub Pages setup (one time):** Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → **GitHub Actions**.

### Publish to npm

npm package: **`bot-signal`** — use `isHuman()` for the simple case, or the full `detect*` / `create*` APIs for advanced signals and scoring.

#### Step 1 — First publish (once, from your computer)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/okasi/bot-signal.git
cd bot-signal
npm install
npm run check
npm login
npm publish --access public
```

#### Step 2 — Enable Trusted Publishing (for GitHub Actions)

1. https://www.npmjs.com/package/bot-signal → **Settings** → **Trusted publishing**
2. **GitHub Actions** → user `okasi`, repo `bot-signal`, workflow `publish.yml`
3. Save

#### Step 3 — Future releases via Actions

```bash
npm version patch
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

Or re-run **Actions → Publish npm → Run workflow**.
